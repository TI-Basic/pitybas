expressions:

1 + 2 (A + 2 * 3)
we need to follow order of operations
we can optimize parens out? - the above becomes 9(A+2)
how do we follow order of operations in simple asm :<

compiler must reorder expressions into order of ops? then we can just execute in order

next: how to break an expression into simple bytecode

If (expr)
Then

End

dedicated expression processing function. find the bounds of the expression, then group (parens), find types (1, "A"), symbols+tokens (+, -, *, /, And, Or)
order the bytecode at each level of parens: (parens, exp, mult, div, add, sub, boolean)

then we can run the bytecode in order.
